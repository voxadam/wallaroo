      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Wallaroo takes the following parameters:
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        --control/-c [Sets address for initializer control channel; sets
          control address to connect to for non-initializers]
        --data/-d [Sets address for initializer data channel]
        --my-control [Optionally sets address for my control channel]
        --my-data [Optionally sets address for my data channel]
        --external/-e [Sets address for external message channel]
        --worker-count/-w [Sets cluster initializer's total number of workers,
          including cluster initializer itself]
        --name/-n [Sets name for this worker]

        --metrics/-m [Sets address for external metrics (e.g. monitoring hub)]
        --cluster-initializer/-t [Sets this process as the cluster
          initializing process (that status is meaningless after init is done)]
        --resilience-dir/-r [Sets directory to write resilience files to,
          e.g. -r /tmp/data (no trailing slash)]
        --resilience-dos-server [Comma-separated list of hostname:port of the remote DOS server(s)]
        --resilience-enable-io-journal [Enables the write-ahead logging
          of all file I/O (regardless of resilience build type)]
        --resilience-no-local-file-io [Disables local file I/O; writes to I/O
          journal are not affected by this flag]
        --log-rotation [Enables log rotation. Default: off]
        --event-log-file-size/-l [Optionally sets rotation size for the event
          log file backend]

        --join/-j [When a new worker is joining a running cluster, pass the
          control channel address of any worker as the value for this
          parameter]
        --stop-pause/-u [Sets pause before state migration after stop the
          world]
        --time-between-checkpoints [Sets the interval between checkpoints for
          resilience (in nanoseconds)]

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      To set Wallaroo modes, compile with the following -D flags:
        resilience - Sets resilience mode
        autoscale - Sets autoscaling mode
        clustering - Sets clustering mode
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      NOTE: There may be app-specific command line options that are not listed
        here
