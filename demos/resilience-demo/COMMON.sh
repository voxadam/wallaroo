# Common variables for controlling the other scripts in this directory.
# I have been testing these scripts using AWS EC2 instances of type
# t3.medium + AMI: Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type,
# ami-04169656fea786776 in the us-east-1 region.

# Assumptions:
#
# 1. The machine that runs these scripts need not be a cluster member
#    machine, e.g., run on your Wallaroo Labs laptop/desktop from home.
#
# 2. All machines must permit SSH access via both their external *and*
#    internal IP addresses.
#    a). SSH from your laptop to each cluster member.
#    b). SSH used by rsync from one cluster member directly to another
#        via internal network addresses.
#
# 3. Each machine is running Ubuntu Linux or something similar,
#    supported by Wallaroo Up.
#
# 4. For on/off variables defined here, valid values are only "y" and "n".

# External IP addresses for each of the 4 machines in this cluster.
# Must be routable by the machine that executes these scripts.

SERVER2_EXT=18.206.124.212
SERVER3_EXT=54.235.60.156
SERVER4_EXT=54.210.170.173

# Internal IP addresses for each cluster member.  If there is no internal
# network interface, then define as SERVER1=$SERVER1_EXT, etc.
# The internal IP addresses are useful in environments like AWS EC2.

# URL for the Wallaroo source repo
# The scripts will only clone this repo once and will not fail/interrupt
# the scripts if the repo already exists.  It's up to the user to manage
# the repo with Git "fetch" & "pull" commands as appropriate, if you're
# doing active code development or debugging.
